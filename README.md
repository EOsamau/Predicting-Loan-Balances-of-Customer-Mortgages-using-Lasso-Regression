### Time-Enhanced ML Regression for Predicting Loan Balances of 50,000 residential U.S. mortgage borrowers:
This project analyzes borrower behavior and loan performance using financial datasets to develop a predictive model. The dataset includes a variety of borrower, loan, and macroeconomic factors, such as loan-to-value ratios, interest rates, house price indices, and credit scores, which influence loan repayment dynamics over time. The primary goal is to use regression to predict the outstanding loan balance at any given observation time. By identifying the key factors that affect the loan balance, this model could help financial institutions better understand loan risk profiles and enhance their decision-making regarding borrower management and loan performance assessment.

### Overview


### About dataset:
Data Set Mortgage:
The data set mortgage is in panel form and reports origination and performance observations for 50,000 residential U.S. mortgage borrowers over 60 periods. 
The periods have been identified. As in the real world, loans may originate before the start of the observation period 
(this is an issue where loans are transferred between banks and investors as in securitization). 
The loan observations may thus be censored as the loans mature or borrowers refinance.
